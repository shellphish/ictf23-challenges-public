    We're training a new state-of-the-art extra-large language model called ELLM. We'll finally be able to solve the ultimate problem of computer science: Telling humans and robots apart. We built a crowd-sourcing application for all humans to
    help us make sure those darn robots are not able to hide among us.

    However, we've heard that the robots have been able to infiltrate our company and hide a secret message in our data. We need you to find it and report it to us. Unfortunately our data center was taken over by the robots and we can't access
    the data anymore. Here's the last version we have been able to reconstruct from our source-code backups. Unfortunately, the backup did not include the secret file. We need your help to save humanity!
