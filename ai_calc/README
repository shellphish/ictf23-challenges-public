```bash
docker build -t aicalc -f ./Dockerfile .
docker run -itd -e API_KEY=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 --name aicalc_container aicalc
```

nc <IP of the container> 11239
```

**Make sure to provide the deployed IP and port in the challenge description.**

## About the API_KEY

Do not send the API_KEY to players. The key is currently billed under Prof. Wenke Lee's lab account and will be destroyed after iCTF ends.

The key is for accessing openai's model GPT3.5-turbo. The challenge has a PoW machenism to prevent API usage abuse. Pwning the challenge is OK and will not leak the API key, as players will not be able to get a shell or read other information.

# Deliveries to Players

All the files under the [src](./src/) directory should be delivered to the players.

```bash
zip ./src.zip -r ./src
# Now, deliver src.zip to the players.
```
