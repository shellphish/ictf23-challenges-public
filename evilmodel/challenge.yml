# This file represents the base specification of your challenge. It is used by
# other tools to install and deploy your challenge.

# Required sections
name: "Evil Model"
author: "ammonia"
category: misc
description: |
    Supersecure Bank, with an advanced malicious file detection system, uses AI from a company called SuperAI. A bad hacker at SuperAI found a way to embed malware into a trained AI model, bypassing Supersecure Bank's detection.
    Later, a bad hacker from the same group at Supersecure Bank extracted the malware from the shipped AI model and executed it.
    The code, model architecture, and weights are provided. Find the hidden flag in the model.

    Hint -
    * Hidden things are in the hidden layer when the last three digits are less significant.
    * The method that you can hide bytes without significantly damaging the model performance is the key to extracting the flag.

# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If not used, remove or set to null
# If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
image: null

# Specify a protocol that should be used to connect to the running image
# For example if the image is a website you can specify http or https
# Otherwise you can specify tcp
protocol: null

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# Optional settings

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge
connection_info: null

# healthcheck is a tool/script used to check a challenge
# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"
healthcheck: null

# Can be removed if unused
# attempts: 5

# Flags specify answers that your challenge use. You should generally provide at least one.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts strings or dictionaries of CTFd API data
flags:
    # A static case sensitive flag
    - ictf{EviLModel:devil}
    # A static case sensitive flag created with a dictionary
    #- {
    #    type: "static",

    # A static case insensitive flag
    #- {

    #    type: "regex",
    #    content: "(.*)STUFF(.*)",
    #    data: "case_insensitive",
    #}

# Topics are used to help tell what techniques/information a challenge involves
# They are generally only visible to admins
# Accepts strings
topics:
    - document misc

# Tags are used to provide additional public tagging to a challenge
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts strings
tags:
    - misc

# Provide paths to files from the same directory that this file is in
# Accepts strings
files:
    - src/model_architecture.json

# Hints are used to give players a way to buy or have suggestions. They are not
# required but can be nice.

# Requirements are used to make a challenge require another challenge to be
# solved before being available.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts challenge names as strings or challenge IDs as integers
#requirements:
#    - "Warmup"
#    - "Are you alive"

# The state of the challenge.
# If the field is omitted, the challenge is visible by default.
# If provided, the field can take one of two values: hidden, visible.
