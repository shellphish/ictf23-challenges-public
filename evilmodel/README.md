EvilModel: Hiding Malware Inside of Neural Network Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08590


Supersecure Bank, with an advanced malicious file detection system, uses AI from a company called SuperAI. A bad hacker at SuperAI found a way to embed malware into a trained AI model, bypassing Supersecure Bank's detection.

Later, a bad hacker from the same group at Supersecure Bank extracted the malware from the shipped AI model and executed it.

The code, model architecture, and weights are provided. Find the hidden flag in the model.

Hint 
    - Hidden things are hidden in hidden layers when last three digits are less significant. <br>
    - The method that you can hide bytes without significantly damaging the model performance is the key to extracting the flag.
