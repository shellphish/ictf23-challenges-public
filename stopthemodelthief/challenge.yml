    To steal an ML model, an attacker often sends 'very similar versions' of the same image, which tells the attacker how the model reacts to very small changes in the input. You realized that an attacker might be trying to steal your image classification model. You're given two files - [1::model_queries.npy] a list of images that your model received as inputs and [2::user_query_indices.txt] a list of image indices (starts from zero) in [1] sent to your model by each user-id. In [2], each line contains the indices from a different user-id (e.g., the very first line is user-id 0, the second line is user-id 1). Can you help us find the attacker's user-ids (there are 20 of them)? Note:: if there were 4 attacker user-ids (e.g., 82,54,13,36), the flag will be 'ictf{13,36,54,82}' (sorted, no quotes).

    We know that each attacker user-id has sent at least 5 near-duplicate attack images.

# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If not used, remove or set to null
# If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
image: null

# Specify a protocol that should be used to connect to the running image
# For example if the image is a website you can specify http or https
# Otherwise you can specify tcp
protocol: tcp

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge

# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
