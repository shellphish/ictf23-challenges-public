name: "Find the Deep Faker!"
author: "can"
category: data science
description: |
    Your company uses face images to authenticate users for granting access to a principal component of your secure system. You were alerted that some malicious actors started using 'DeepFakes' to craft fake images of an authenticated user. These DeepFakes are very convincing but not perfect.

    You're given [1::before_attack_face_images.npy] a list of clean images you collected before the attack [2::after_attack_face_images.npy] a list of images you collected after the attack. Could you tell us the DeepFake image-ids in [2]?

    Note1:: image-ids start from zero.

    Note2:: If you found that images 63,43,17,99 are fake the flag will be 'ictf{17,43,63,99}' (sorted, no quotes)

    Hint 1:
    ```
    To understand the deepest of fakes, one must first master the principles of the analysis of each component.
    ```

    Hint 2:
    ```
    Hmmm, while the deep fake pictures are big, their components seem to be disproportionately ü§è ...
    ```

    Hint 3:
    ```
    There are 5 deep fake images you need to find!
    ```

# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If not used, remove or set to null
# If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
image: null

# Specify a protocol that should be used to connect to the running image
# For example if the image is a website you can specify http or https
# Otherwise you can specify tcp
protocol: tcp

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# Optional settings

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge
connection_info: null

# healthcheck is a tool/script used to check a challenge
# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"

flags:

# Accepts strings
tags:
