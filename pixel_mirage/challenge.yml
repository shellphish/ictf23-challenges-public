# Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# If not used, remove or set to null
# If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
image: .

# Specify a protocol that should be used to connect to the running image
# For example if the image is a website you can specify http or https
# Otherwise you can specify tcp
protocol: tcp

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# Optional settings

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge
connection_info: null

# healthcheck is a tool/script used to check a challenge
# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"
#healthcheck: writeup/exploit.sh

# Can be removed if unused
