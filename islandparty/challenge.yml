  You open your mailbox and find a strange postcard (invite.bmp).
  Flipping it around, you squint your eyes and try to decipher the wobbly handwriting:
  
  MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'On this most auspicious end of year, I _otter_ invite you to my most magnanimous island party!'
  
  YOU: 'This must be one of rich Jared's infamous parties, huh.'
  
  MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'Generative AI is all the rage this days, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to use it for this year's invite.
  Have you heard models like Google's Imagen will include a hidden watermark on AI generated images?
  I might not have algorithms quite as fancy as Google's, but I've also encoded a little something into this invite--the address!
  Decode it, and you'll be more than welcome to attend.'
  
  YOU: 'Who on Earth tells their guests to just figure out the address themselves?!'
  
  MYSTERIOUS INVITE: 'One last piece of advice. All great thing come in three. Three sides to a triangle, three wise monkeys, three lights in a stoplight.
  Let the number three guide you, and you shall find my island.'
  
  YOU: 'How is a stoplight a great thing? *Sigh* I can't say I understand the guy, but an island party is an island party. Let's get decoding, I guess.'
  
  Objective: Determine the name of the island. The flag will be the name of the island enclosed by curly braces and prepended with ictf.
  Example: If the party were hosted in Happy Coconut Island, the flag would be ictf{Happy Coconut Island}

      YOU: 'This is a really weird invite. 
      I vaguely remember reading about hidden watermarks at https://invisiblewatermark.net/how-invisible-watermarks-work before, maybe I should review that.
      And Jared's weird rambling about the number three... The hidden watermark must be related to the number three somehow...
      I feel like I'm close to cracking this... Let's give it another shot!'
